<h2>Our Aims</h2>    
<p style="font-size:120%;">The aim of DCER is to gain electoral
     reform in the UK. Where we differ from other campaigns
      is that we are working towards getting defined reforms
      with support from the broadest possible base.</p>    
<p style="font-size:120%;">Any political party's interest 
    regarding electoral reform is not the same as the electorate's. Therefore they should not be exclusively
    entrusted to move the process forward without the clearest possible  
    mandate of those with the interest, the electorate. Constituency parties collectively have a broad base, few interests conflicting with the electorate and influence over their parties. 
    DCER will gather the support of constituency 
     parties specifically 
     to mandate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly">
    Citizens' assemblies</a> to decide on what the 
     the reforms should be. The national partys will then have a 
     democratic obligation to their memberships to 
     include the reforms in their manifestos.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">As well as reform of the Parliamentary electoral system, 
    the popular election of a change of PM mid term
     and an elected second chamber are also supported by DCER.</p>
<h3>What to do now</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">DCER is seeking motions to be passed by constituency
    parties in order to mandate a citizens' assembly. There is a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">skeleton templete for Labour here</a> with the essential functions and argument. Input for motions for other parties' would be appreciated. Individuals can also show their support for 
    our aims <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>Some notes & implications</h3>
<p style="font-size:110%;">It is also important that the differnt 
    parties have the same policies for reform as differences 
    would weaken messaging in the election. Differences 
    would be exploited by the opposition as a sign of complexity and source of confusion.
    </p>
     <p style="font-size:110%;">Commonly held policies on electoral reform could form the basis for electoral alliance arrangements, meaning parties supporting the same reforms are more likely to succeed.
        The same reform policy 
    would also assist the formation of a coalition if necessary.
